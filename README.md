Deep Learning Models for Image and Text Processing
This repository contains implementations for various deep learning models for tasks like image reconstruction using autoencoders, text generation with RNNs, and sentiment analysis using LSTM. Below is a brief description of each task and how to run the corresponding scripts.

1. Autoencoder for Image Reconstruction
Objective:
This script builds a fully connected autoencoder using the MNIST dataset. The goal is to encode and reconstruct the image data by reducing the dimensionality in the hidden layers.

Features:
Encoder: Input layer (784), hidden layer (32).

Decoder: Hidden layer (32), output layer (784).

Loss function: Binary cross-entropy loss.

Running the Script:
Clone the repository or download the script.

Install necessary libraries using pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib.

Run the script, which will:

Load the MNIST dataset.

Train a fully connected autoencoder model.

Plot the original vs. reconstructed images.

Expected Output:
Original MNIST digits compared with reconstructed digits after training the autoencoder.

2. Denoising Autoencoder
Objective:
This script is a modification of the autoencoder model that includes Gaussian noise added to the input data. The denoising autoencoder learns to reconstruct the clean input images from noisy inputs.

Features:
Gaussian noise with mean=0, std=0.5 is added to the input data.

The output of the autoencoder is the original (clean) image.

Running the Script:
Clone the repository or download the script.

Install necessary libraries using pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib.

Run the script, which will:

Add noise to the MNIST dataset.

Train the denoising autoencoder.

Visualize the noisy vs. reconstructed images.

Expected Output:
Comparison of original, noisy, and reconstructed images.

Real-World Use Case:
Denoising autoencoders are useful in fields like medical imaging, where they can help remove noise from MRI or CT scans, improving the clarity of diagnostics.

3. RNN for Text Generation
Objective:
This script builds a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using LSTM layers to generate new text based on a given input string. The model is trained on Shakespeare's sonnets and generates new text character by character.

Features:
Uses the Shakespeare Sonnets text as the training dataset.

LSTM model to predict the next character based on the previous sequence.

Temperature scaling for controlling randomness in the generated text.

Running the Script:
Clone the repository or download the script.

Install necessary libraries using pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib.

Run the script, which will:

Preprocess the Shakespeare dataset.

Train the LSTM-based model.

Generate new text with temperature scaling of 0.5 and 1.0.

Expected Output:
Generated text based on the input string like "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?" with two temperature settings (0.5 and 1.0).

Temperature Scaling Explained:
Low temperature (< 1.0): Results in less randomness and more predictable text.

High temperature (> 1.0): Results in more creative but unpredictable text.

4. Sentiment Classification Using LSTM
Objective:
This script builds an LSTM-based sentiment analysis model using the IMDB dataset. It classifies movie reviews as either positive or negative based on the text.

Features:
Uses LSTM layers to classify reviews as positive or negative.

Confusion Matrix and Classification Report (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) for evaluation.

Running the Script:
Clone the repository or download the script.

Install necessary libraries using pip install tensorflow scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn.

Run the script, which will:

Load the IMDB dataset.

Train the sentiment classifier.

Display the confusion matrix and classification report.

Expected Output:
A confusion matrix showing the true vs. predicted sentiment labels.

A classification report containing accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Precision-Recall Tradeoff:
Precision: Measures how many of the predicted positive reviews were actually positive.

Recall: Measures how many actual positive reviews were correctly predicted.

In sentiment analysis, a high recall is essential when you want to catch all the negative reviews (e.g., automatic moderation systems), while a high precision is important when false positives are costly (e.g., wrongly flagging a positive review).
